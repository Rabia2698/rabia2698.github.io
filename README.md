## About Me
Hi, Rabia Here 👋 An engineering graduate from Universiti Malaysia Perlis who loves all things tech and innovation! I get excited about turning ideas into real solutions — whether it’s through coding in Python and C, crunching data with MATLAB, sketching designs in AutoCAD, or building cool stuff on the web. I’m always curious, always learning, and always ready to take on new challenges. When I’m not coding or designing, you’ll find me exploring new projects, researching, or just geeking out over creative ideas 🚀.
